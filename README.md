# Design of Two-stage fully compensated OPAMP

This is one of my academic project from Spring 2018 semester.
Course: __EECT 6326: Analog Integrated Circuits Design__.
Professor: __Dr. Sudipto Chakraborty__.
In this course I got an introduction to the principles of analog IC design. I aquired the knowledge of circuit level analog IC design required in industry and research. With this knowledge, I designed an _Two stage Operational Amplifier with miller compensation and programmable nulling resistor_.

NOTE1:  I am going to skip the derivations of the formulas that I am using in this project. All these derivations can be found on the internet very easily. One of the source I would suggest is textbook by P. Allen and D. Holberg,"CMOS Analog Circuit Design",The Oxford Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering, 3rd ed.

NOTE2: You can go through this text or you can just refer the [project report](https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/AICD%20Project.pdf) I made which is attached in the same repository.

NOTE3: The step numbers do not match with the numbers in images below. It is of least concern. The procedure follows a correct flow.


The project flow goes as follows:
1. Declaring design specifications.
2. Getting values of threshold voltages (Vthn and |Vthp|) and process-transconductances for both PMOS and NMOS (μpCox and μnCox).
3. Deciding values of compensation capacitor (Cc) and bias current (I) from given load capacitor and Slew Rate.
4. Design of input transistors.
5. Design of mirror load transistors and tail current source transistor for first stage.
6. Design of second stage input transistor.
7. Design of current source transistor for second stage. (Once this it done, we will check the reponse of the OPAMP without nulling resistor. If needed, then)
8. Design of nulling resistor and its bias circuitary transistors.

Once the design is complete, the circuit is tested for all the specification to confirm if it is working as the desired target specifications mentioned in step 1.

So without delay, let's start designing!

## 1. Declaring design specifications.
We are required to design an OPAMP having load capacitor CL = 10pF with the 3.3 volts power supply. I used the TSMC CMOS 0.35-μm technology for this project. An OPAMP was designed to best meet the following specificatons:
- Differential voltage gain: Avd ≥ 60dB.
- Output voltage swing range: OVSR = Vo(max) -Vo(min) ≥ 2V.
- Slew rate: SR ≥ 10 V/μS.
- Input common mode range: ICMR ≥ 1.8V.
- Common mode rejection ratio: CMRR ≥ 70 dB.
- Unity Gain-bandwidth: GB ≥ 8 MHz with a 10 pF load capacitance.
- Phase Margin: f(GB) ≥ 60° with a 10 pF load capacitance.
- Power dissipation: Pdiss ≤ 1mW.

## 2. Getting values of threshold voltages (Vthn and |Vthp|) and process-transconductances for both PMOS and NMOS (μpCox and μnCox).
The most important parameters that we need during the calculation and which are not available with us imitially are threshold voltages and process trans conductances of the devices which we will be using throughout our designing. The only way to get them is by simulation. For that, I set up the NMOS and PMOS devices in diode connected fashion and forced 30μA of current through them with Vdd = 3.3 volts. The screenshot of this setup is as shown below.

<p align="center">

</p>

I did DC Analysis on this setup. Once done I got the following values:

| Parameter                | NMOS             | PMOS           |
| ------------------------ |:----------------:| :-------------:|
| Threshold voltage        | Vtn_min = 0.52 V | /Vtp/ = 0.96 V |
|                          | Vtn_max = 0.96 V |                |
| Process transconductance | 200μA/V          |         60μA/v |

Now that we have the required unknowns, we can proceed to design stpes.

## 3. Deciding values of compensation capacitor (Cc) and bias current (I) from given load capacitor and Slew Rate.
The initial circuit for the system will be as shown below. I will make changes if thensystem doesn't meet the requred specifications.

</p>

We have target Slew rate and given Load capacitor CL in the specification. We also have the target of Phase margin > 60 degree.
The condition for 60 degree phase margin is Cc>=0.22xCL Hence, for our project Cc should be more than or equal to 2.2pF. I am choosing value of Cc to **Cc = 3pF**
Now, SR = I5/Cc. From this we can calculate **I5 = SR x Cc = 30μA**.


## 4. Design of input transistors M1 and M2.

</p>

## 5. Design of mirror load transistors and tail current source transistor for first stage(M3, M4 and M5).

<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Step%204.jpg" />
</p>

Please keep a note that I have changed the sizes of input transistors from what we got initially. Therefore, the input transistor gm is also changed.


## 6. Design of second stage input transistor M6
Key things to keep in mind while designing 2nd input stage is that, it should properly mirror the current from first stage (blancing) and it should be sized in such a way that the output pole will go beyond our frequency of interests so that it will not create any concerns for us while designing.

</p>

## 7. Design of current source transistor for second stage M7.
The current flowing from M6 will be same as the one flowing from M7. Als, M7 will form mirror with M5. Hench keeping that in mind, we have to size M7. Normally, S7 = 1/2x(S6)

Now we have all the W/L ratios of the transistors for the circuit we were aiming to build. When designed in cadence and plotted AC response by doing AC analysis we got following result.
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Schematic%20without%20nulling%20resistor.jpg" />
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Plot%20Without%20Nulling%20Resistor.jpg" />
</p>

From the frequency response we can see that the phase margin that we got with this configuration is not what we expected. It is significantly low and we need make changes in the circuit.

## 8.Design of nulling resistor and its bias circuitary transistors.
As seen above, we did not get the required phase margin and we deciced to put the nulling resistor in series with the compensation capcitor. This can be implemented by using an ideal resistor but it is always a good pratice to try to design everything using MOS when designing IC. Based on the observed common mode signal at the output it is recommended to use a PMOS device (M8) to implement this resistor. The gate voltage for this PMOS can be anything which will make sure that it is turned on (even though there will not be any DC current flowing through it because of the capcitor in series). If we make this gate voltage fixed then this topology will work only for fixed load. To make it 'programmable' for any loads following arrangement can be made.
The following diagram also follows the calculations of aspect ratios of newly added transistors to the system (M8, M9, M10, M11)

Once this is done, I made the corresponding changes in the previous circuit in cadence and simulated it.
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Schematic%20After%20inserting%20Nulling%20resistor.jpg" />
</p>

From above image, we can see that all the transistors are in saturation region which proves that we are going in right direction. After this I plotted the AC reponse of the circuit as shown below.
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Response%20after%20inserting%20nulling%20resistor.jpg" />
</p>

We can clearly see that the new __phase margin we got is 82 degree__ which is very excellent. The DC gain of the circuit is __Av(0)=Adm=65.57db__. Also the gain bandwidth is __GBW = 24MHz__.

I this way out OPAMP designing part is done. Now we have to test this OPAMP in various configuration to see if it is meeting other required specifications or not.

This procedure proceeds as follows:
### 1. Calculation of Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)
We know that __CMRR(dB) = Adm(dB) - Acm(dB)__. We already have the value of Adm = 65.57dB. We now need to calculate the commo mode gain. This can calculated by doing following setup. Here I have given a common mode signal at the output and I have plotted a frequency response.
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Common%20mode%20gain%20setup.jpg" />
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Common%20mode%20gain%20plot.jpg" />
</p>

From the response we can see that the Acm = -15.36dB. Hence the CMRR is, __CMRR = Acm – Adm = 65.57 - (-15.36) = 80.9dB__, which is very excellent.

### 2. Calculation of power dissipation
Total current flowing through circuit according to calculation is __Total Current = (30+30+7.5+210)μA = 277.5μA__. Hence the total power dissipated should be __Pdiss = 3.3V x 277.5μA = 0.915mW__. Lets see if the actual circuit also gives the same power or not.
To calculate power dissipation, I did DC analysis the, Analog Environment>Tools>Result Browser>dcOp-dc>:pwr>Right click"Table". The __power dissipation was 1.012mW__

</p>

### 3. Calculation of Slew Rate.
We know that according to target specifications the slew rate should be 10V/μsec. Lets see how much we are actually getting. Below is the setup for calculation of SR. I connected inverting terminal to output in unity gain closed loop form and provided pulse input at the non-inverting terminal and observed the transient reponse.
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Slew%20rate%20setup.jpg" />
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Slew%20rate%20plot.jpg" />
</p>

From the above graph we see that, +SR = 13.82V/μsec and |-SR| = 11.045V/μsec. The average slew rate is __SR = 12.43V/μsec__. Our target was 10V/μsec hence the result is satisfactory.

### 4. Calculation of Output Voltage Swing Range (OVSR)
OVSR is nothing but Vout_max and Vout_min. We can calculate them as follows
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/OVSR%20calculation.jpg" />
</p>
Figures below shows the setup to calculate OVSR and its reponse.
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/OVSR%20setup.jpg" />
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/OVSR%20plot.jpg" />
</p>

In later figure, the plot above is the plot of Vout when Vin_CM is changes from 0 volt to 3.3 volts. The plot below shows the derivative of it. The markers were first kept in 2nd plot at the (rising point + 10%) and (falling point - 10%). The x-values of those points were noted and markers were placed on same X co-ordinates in the plot above. This gave the total OVSR. From figure  we can see that __0.095V < Vout< 3.075V__

### 5. Calculation of Input Common Mode Range (ICMR)
To calculate the ICMR, I gave a random AC signal and I varied the Input common mode signal from 0 voltss to 3.3 volts. I observed the point with highest gain and 3db below point of it and noted the corresponding X co-ordinate values. The setup and plot is as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/ICMR%20setup.jpg" />
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/ICMR%20plot.jpg" />
</p>
From the plot we see that, 0.66 V < ICMR < 3.12 V.


To test this OPAMP I implemented a comparator and a Schmitt Trigger circuit using this OPAMP. The figure below shows the schematic setup of the Comparator (left) anf Schmitt Trigger (right).
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Schmitt%20Trigger%20and%20comparator%20setup.jpg" />
</p>
I ran transient analysis on both of these circuits and applied noisy input to both of them to get the following plot.
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/akash10295/Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP/blob/master/Screenshots/Schmitt%20Trigger%20and%20comparator%20plot.jpg" />
</p>

The first waveform is noisy sinewave. Second waveform is the reponse of a comparator and third wave is the reponse of a Schmitt Trigger.
